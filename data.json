When he arrived at the Pharisee&#x2019;s house and took his place at table, a woman came in, who had a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment. She waited behind him at his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them away with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them with the ointment.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &#x2018;If this man were a prophet, he would know who this woman is that is touching him and what a bad name she has.&#x2019; Then Jesus took him up and said, &#x2018;Simon, I have something to say to you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Speak, Master&#x2019; was the reply. &#x2018;There was once a creditor who had two men in his debt; one owed him five hundred denarii, the other fifty. They were unable to pay, so he pardoned them both. Which of them will love him more?&#x2019; &#x2018;The one who was pardoned more, I suppose&#x2019; answered Simon. Jesus said, &#x2018;You are right.&#x2019;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;Then he turned to the woman. &#x2018;Simon,&#x2019; he said &#x2018;you see this woman? I came into your house, and you poured no water over my feet, but she has poured out her tears over my feet and wiped them away with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but she has been covering my feet with kisses ever since I came in. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. For this reason I tell you that her sins, her many sins, must have been forgiven her, or she would not have shown such great love. It is the man who is forgiven little who shows little love.&#x2019; Then he said to her, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven.&#x2019; Those who were with him at table began to say to themselves, &#x2018;Who is this man, that he even forgives sins?&#x2019; But he said to the woman, &#x2018;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&#x2019;</div>",

As he sowed, some fell on the edge of the path and was trampled on; and the birds of the air ate it up. Some seed fell on rock, and when it came up it withered away, having no moisture. Some seed fell amongst thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it. And some seed fell into rich soil and grew and produced its crop a hundredfold.&#x2019; Saying this he cried, &#x2018;Listen, anyone who has ears to hear!&#x2019;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;His disciples asked him what this parable might mean, and he said, &#x2018;The mysteries of the kingdom of God are revealed to you; for the rest there are only parables, so that</div><div style=\"text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top:0.8em;\">they may see but not perceive,</div><div style=\"text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;\">listen but not understand.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; margin-top:0.8em;\">&#x2018;This, then, is what the parable means: the seed is the word of God. Those on the edge of the path are people who have heard it, and then the devil comes and carries away the word from their hearts in case they should believe and be saved. Those on the rock are people who, when they first hear it, welcome the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of trial they give up. As for the part that fell into thorns, this is people who have heard, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life and do not reach maturity. As for the part in the rich soil, this is people with a noble and generous heart who have heard the word and take it to themselves and yield a harvest through their perseverance.&#x2019;</div>",

To do this is right, and will please God our saviour: he wants everyone to be saved and reach full knowledge of the truth. For there is only one God, and there is only one mediator between God and mankind, himself a man, Christ Jesus, who sacrificed himself as a ransom for them all. He is the evidence of this, sent at the appointed time, and I have been named a herald and apostle of it and&#xa0;&#x2013; I am telling the truth and no lie&#xa0;&#x2013; a teacher of the faith and the truth to the pagans.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;In every place, then, I want the men to lift their hands up reverently in prayer, with no anger or argument.</div>",

He called for the man and said, &#x201c;What is this I hear about you? Draw me up an account of your stewardship because you are not to be my steward any longer.&#x201d; Then the steward said to himself, &#x201c;Now that my master is taking the stewardship from me, what am I to do? Dig? I am not strong enough. Go begging? I should be too ashamed. Ah, I know what I will do to make sure that when I am dismissed from office there will be some to welcome me into their homes.&#x201d;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;Then he called his master&#x2019;s debtors one by one. To the first he said, &#x201c;How much do you owe my master?&#x201d; &#x201c;One hundred measures of oil&#x201d; was the reply. The steward said, &#x201c;Here, take your bond; sit down straight away and write fifty.&#x201d; To another he said, &#x201c;And you, sir, how much do you owe?&#x201d; &#x201c;One hundred measures of wheat&#x201d; was the reply. The steward said, &#x201c;Here, take your bond and write eighty.&#x201d;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify; text-indent:1em;\">&#160;&#160;&#x2018;The master praised the dishonest steward for his astuteness.

The man who can be trusted in little things can be trusted in great; the man who is dishonest in little things will be dishonest in great. If then you cannot be trusted with money, that tainted thing, who will trust you with genuine riches?
